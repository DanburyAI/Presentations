## Monthly Meetings 
**July 2016: Welcome to Danbury AI**
Danbury AI is a public AI meetup group hosted by the Danbury Hackerspace that aims to stimulate discussion in the vast 
field of artificial intelligence and bring together locals that foster a passion for the field. We hold our in person 
meetings on the first Tuesday of every month at which we host a variety of presenters, discussions, and workshops. 
We maintain a lively web presence via slack so the conversation never stops.

**August 2016: Machine Learning with TensorFlow**
TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. 
Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays 
(tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or 
GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and 
engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes 
of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in 
a wide variety of other domains as well.
